<b>pyportscan.py</b> is a port scanner I created written in python. It uses a simple multi threaded technique and will try to connect to every port you define either range for `-r` option or specified ports using `-s` followed by port numbers separated by commas.

This program is intended for individuals or pentesters to test their network to automate the process of checking what ports are opened on a remote server.
